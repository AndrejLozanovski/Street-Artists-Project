Mobile application for street artists and customers (visitors). This application is SPA but in JS only.

The logic is more on the side of the artists, where they can track their masterpiece on the app. By tracking i mean to see how much item they have sold, what's their income, adding, publish/unpublish, editting, removing items and sending an item to an auction.

Visitors can only see published items from the artists, list throught them, filter them by the artist name, title, price range and type of the painting.
